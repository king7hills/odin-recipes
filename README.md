Recipe website project

In this project, I will demonstrate an understanding of git usage and basic html skills. This project may grow to include CSS and JavaScript skills, but for now (12/2/24) it will be a demonstration of my ability to utilize git and create foundational webpages using html.

Initial Project Completion notes:

12/2/24 13:36 EST
I was able to successfully build a basic html website which contains three of my favorite recipes. The recipe pages show an image of the finished food, ingredients, and directions.
I formatted these pages properly and everything seems to be working well.
A also utlized git to commit several versions of the project. The commit messages clearly show what changes were made along the way. I'm still figuring out push frequency.

I enjoyed this project and will expand upon it with several more recipes in the future. It would be nice to host all of my recipes in one place, 
that way I can easily send a link to the homepage for others to enjoy.
